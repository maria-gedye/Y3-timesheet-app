# timesheet_app

This is my first flutter app which is my submission for the Yoobee assessment CS301 'MVP'.

Currently built for android only.

## INSTALLATION GUIDE   (˵ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°˵)
this title explicitly lets you know that you are about to read an installation guide I created so you can run my MVP application 
(˵ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°˵)

### Instructions for running this project (for moderators, supervisors, tutors)
